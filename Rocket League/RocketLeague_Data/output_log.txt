[Physics.PhysX] ConvexHullBuilder: convex hull has more than 255 polygons!
[Physics.PhysX] Gu::ConvexMesh::loadConvexHull: convex hull init failed! Try to use the PxConvexFlag::eINFLATE_CONVEX flag. (see PxToolkit::createConvexMeshSafe)
Failed to create Convex Mesh from source mesh "CC_ME_Body_R4". Source mesh is likely have too many smooth surface regions. Please reduce the surface smoothness of the source mesh. Alternatively turn on Inflate Mesh and increase the Skin Width sufficiently for this mesh.
